# Disjoint Set (Or Union-Find) I set 1 (Detect Cycle in a Undirected Graph)

* A disjoin-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure.
