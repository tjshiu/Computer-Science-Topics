# Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

A __recursive__ method is one that calls itself and with each time the method calls itself it tries to solve a smaller __subproblem__.

### Basics of Recursion:
* __base cases__ - a recursive methods should eventually reach a base case, or they just loop forever.
